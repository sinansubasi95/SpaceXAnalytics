1) Should I separate Launches file/page into two different files/pages?
2) Create GraphQL Query to fetch id specific launch.
3) Create table component for id specific launch page.
4) SpaceX patch placeholder
5) index.tsx must be .ts
6) Should layouts have ui attr or not? Alternatively, components can be created in children.

7.1) Or call query from a service or component?
